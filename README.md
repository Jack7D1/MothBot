# MothBot
An asyncronous Text Bot that monitors recieved Discord messages via Discord.Net API. 
If a valid command or contextually significant message is read, it is passed along to the root command tree which passes along the message to the contextually desired module(s).
This bot is not too well designed and has been worked on in small bursts in my free time.
