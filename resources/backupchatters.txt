forgive me lads, for i have gamed, and just remembered a fucking incredibly dumb childhood story and i now desire to share it for no reason in particular
when i was 3 i was brought to the swimming pool for the first time and i was told i am not allowed to piss in the water (which to this day i can proudly say i have not actually done excepting this singular story) but the way it was worded 3 year old me apparently took it like a riddle of "you have to piss, but you cant do it inside of the pool" so i thought i had to piss before i was allowed in, so apparently according to legend i went over to the edge of the pool (RIGHT NEXT TO 2 LIFE GUARDS) and pulled down my pants and proceeded to piss into the pool from out the pool, resulting in a somewhat older kid panicing in order to get away from toddler-piss being dispensed into the pool, who then proceeded to thrash around wildly and become unable to stay afloat, resulting in one lifeguard having to jump in RIGHT WHERE I HAD PISSED to get him out while the other lifeguard was having a laughing fit.
and i am deeply ashamed for this but apparently i caused that pool's house rules to change to define their policy on pool-pissing
then do a 10 to 6 or something?
well, that works

The mouse is your primary method of surveying the battle, selecting units and structures, and issuing orders.
To pan the camera, simple move the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen. Do this now.
You can zoom in on something to see it up close by spinning the mouse wheel forward. Do this now.
{WHEN SQUAD CAP IS REACHED} To increase the number of Squads you can field in Dawn of War, you click on the research items located on your Stronghold.
Remember, holding Strategic Points increases your Requisition Resource. Without sufficient Requisition Resource, you cannot build the force you need to ensure your dominance of the battlefield.
